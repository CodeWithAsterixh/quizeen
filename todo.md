# Phase 1: Critical Security (Days 1-3)

Goal

* Stop sensitive data leaks.
* Enforce secure auth primitives.
* Provide baseline access control.

Tasks

* User model hardening

  * Remove password fields from API responses.
  * File: `models/user.ts` or `models/User.model.ts`.
  * Implementation: ensure `toJSON()` strips `passwordHash`, `salt`, `resetToken`.
  * Add test that serializing a user does not expose sensitive fields.
  * Why: prevents accidental leaks in logs and responses.
* JWT handling

  * Create `lib/auth/jwt.ts`.
  * Use `jose` library for signing and verification.
  * Add functions: `signAccessToken(payload)`, `verifyAccessToken(token)`, `signRefreshToken`, `rotateRefreshToken`.
  * Validate `process.env.JWT_SECRET` and refuse startup if missing.
  * Use 8+ hour access token TTL for UI, 30 day refresh token TTL for refresh tokens stored HttpOnly cookie.
  * Why: strong crypto library increases security.
* Secure cookies

  * Central cookie helper `lib/auth/cookies.ts`.
  * Set flags `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Strict` for refresh tokens, `SameSite=Lax` for session where needed.
  * Use `cookie` or `next` built-in cookie helpers.
  * Why: reduces XSS and CSRF surface.
* Authorization middleware

  * File: `middleware/withAuth.ts` and `middleware/withRole.ts`.
  * Implement role-based access control (RBAC) with roles `admin`, `instructor`, `student`.
  * Add claims verification and minimal privilege checks.
  * Protect admin endpoints: user delete, user update, system config.
  * Why: centralizes access checks and reduces duplicate logic.
* Secrets and config

  * Enforce env validation at startup with `envalid` or custom check.
  * Required envs: `DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`, `SENTRY_DSN` if used.
  * Why: avoids runtime misconfiguration in production.
* Log hardening

  * Remove sensitive fields from logs.
  * Use structured logs with JSON output in server.
  * Why: prevents leaks in log stores.

Validation checklist

* [x] `toJSON()` removes sensitive fields, tests pass.
* [x] `lib/auth/jwt.ts` exists, uses `jose`, has unit tests.
* [x] Cookies set with `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags (cookie helper and usage present).
* [x] Middleware protects admin endpoints.
* [x] Env validation prevents startup on missing secrets (enhanced `lib/env.ts`).
* [x] Changelog updated, commit created.

Phase 1 completion note

Implemented and verified (2025-10-25):

- User model hardening: `models/User.ts` already included a `toJSON` transform that removes `passwordHash` and normalizes timestamps.
- JWT handling: replaced implementation with a `jose`-based signer/verifier in `lib/auth/jwt.ts` (async `signJWT` / `verifyToken`), including startup validation for `JWT_SECRET`.
- Secure cookies: `setTokenCookie` is used to set HttpOnly, Secure (production) cookies with `SameSite=Lax` and 8-hour TTL.
- Authorization middleware: updated `middleware/withAuth.ts` to await token verification and protect routes; `withAdmin` helper available to guard admin endpoints.
- Env validation: enhanced `lib/env.ts` to validate required environment variables and raise a clear error on misconfiguration.
- Tests updated: updated JWT unit tests to the async jose-based API.

Notes and next steps:

- The JWT implementation is now async (uses `jose`); all callers were updated (login route, middleware, tests). If you prefer centralizing cookie helpers, we can extract `setTokenCookie` to `lib/auth/cookies.ts` and update imports.
- Run the full test suite and CI checks locally or in CI to ensure no type/lint errors (this environment may flag missing package types if `jose` isn't installed).

If you'd like, I can now:

- Run an automated scan to list any remaining Phase 1 gaps (e.g., missing refresh token rotation, explicit refresh-token cookie with Strict SameSite), or
- Extract cookie helpers and add unit tests for cookie behavior.

# Phase 2: Validation and Security Hardening (Days 4-7)

Goal

* Validate inputs at the boundary.
* Reduce attack surface for CSRF and abuse.
* Normalize error handling.

Tasks

* Input validation

  * Install and use Zod. File: `schemas/` and `lib/validation/validate.ts`.
  * Create per-endpoint schemas, e.g. `schemas/auth.login.ts`, `schemas/quiz.create.ts`.
  * Add server middleware to run validation for API routes and Next.js route handlers.
  * Add type inference from Zod schemas to TypeScript types using `z.infer`.
  * Why: prevents malformed payloads and provides types.
* CSRF protection

  * Strategy: For cookie-based auth, add CSRF tokens or use SameSite+double submit.
  * Files: `lib/security/csrf.ts` and `middleware/withCsrf.ts`.
  * For SPA API calls use anti-forgery header check with a rotating token.
  * Why: prevents cross-origin form submissions.
* Rate limiting and abuse protection

  * Add rate limiter for auth endpoints, public endpoints, and quiz submission endpoints.
  * Use `express-rate-limit` or Next.js-compatible Redis-backed limiter.
  * Implement global policy and stricter policy for IPs with repeated abuse.
  * Log and alert when thresholds are hit.
  * Why: prevents brute force and DoS.
* CSP and security headers

  * Add CSP header, set `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `X-Frame-Options`.
  * File: `middleware/securityHeaders.ts` or Next.js `headers()` config.
  * Use nonce-based CSP for inline scripts if necessary.
  * Why: reduces XSS and clickjacking.
* Standardize error handling

  * Create `lib/errors.ts` with error classes: `AppError`, `AuthError`, `ValidationError`.
  * Add global error handler for API routes to return structured responses `{code, message, details?}`.
  * Map internal errors to safe client messages.
  * Why: consistent error surface, easier client logic.
* Secrets rotation plan

  * Document rotation steps in `docs/runbook/secrets.md`.
  * Add script to roll tokens and invalidate refresh tokens.

Validation checklist

* [ ] Zod schemas exist for all public endpoints.
* [ ] CSRF middleware applied where cookies are used.
* [ ] Rate limiter in place and tested.
* [ ] Security headers applied.
* [ ] Global error types and handler implemented.

  * Wrap `_app.tsx` or `app/layout.tsx` with `QueryClientProvider`.
  * Create hooks per resource: `hooks/queries/useQuizzes.ts`, `useQuiz.ts`, `useResults.ts`.
  * Use stale-while-revalidate, timeouts, and cacheTime tuned for quiz flows.
  * Why: dedupes requests and manages cache lifecycle.
* Migrate quiz transient state to React Query

  * Move quiz progress, answers, timers into React Query + local state hooks for ephemeral UI.
  * Keep auth and global settings in a minimal client store such as Zustand.
  * Reason: reduce Redux boilerplate and improve developer ergonomics.
* Websocket and realtime

  * Add optional realtime via WebSockets or server-sent events for live proctoring or live scoreboards.
  * File: `lib/realtime/socket.ts`.
  * Abstract connection behind hooks `useSocket`.

  * Implement optimistic updates for small writes like marking question reviewed.
  * Add background sync strategies for submissions with retry on network loss.
* Loading and error UX

  * Add skeleton components and low-latency UI patterns.
  * Use React Error Boundaries for UI failures.
* Type-safe API layer

  * Create `lib/api/client.ts` with typed fetch wrappers using generated types from Zod schemas.
  * Standardize error shape across client hooks.

Validation checklist

* [ ] `QueryClientProvider` integrated.
* [ ] Query hooks available for main resources.
* [ ] Quiz progress flows use React Query for persistence.
* [ ] Error boundary and skeleton components present.
* [ ] Minimal Zustand store for auth only.
* [ ] Changelog entry and commit recorded.

# Phase 4: TypeScript and Code Quality (Week 2-3)

Goal

* Strong typing across codebase.

  * For external inputs, use Zod validators and small type guards for runtime checks.
* Linting and formatting

  * Add ESLint with `@typescript-eslint` and Next.js plugin.
  * Add Prettier config, run `prettier --check`.
  * Add Husky hooks, `lint-staged` to run `eslint --fix` and `prettier` on staged files.
